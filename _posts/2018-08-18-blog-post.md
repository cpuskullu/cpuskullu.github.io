If Paris is a lady, Vienna will be a baroness. You should find a spot to watch these precious cities at the sunset while the sky is turning from red to nightblue. Don't forget your wine be with you: you may choose a Schaumwein for Vienna, which is a soft - sparkling wine. It would be good start for the Vienna nights.
