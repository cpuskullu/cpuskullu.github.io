If Paris is a lady, Vienna will be a baroness. Let me draw another analogy: if Paris is red wine, Vienna will be white wine. Vienna still has both gravity and softness, due to its most recent noble background than other Europen cities. However you should find a good spot to enjoy these precious cities scenery at the sunset while the sky is turning from red to nightblue. Don't forget your wine will be with you: you may choose a Schaumwein for Vienna, which is a soft - sparkling wine, it would be good start for the Vienna nights.
