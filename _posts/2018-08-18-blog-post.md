If Paris is a lady, Vienna will be a baroness. Let me draw another analogy: if Paris is red wine, Vienna will be white wine. Vienna still has both gravity and softness, due to its most recent noble background than other Europen cities. However you should find a good spot to enjoy these precious cities scenery at the sunset while the sky is turning from red to nightblue. Don't forget your wine will be with you: you may choose a *schaumwein* for Vienna, which is a soft - sparkling wine, it would be good start for the Vienna nights.

The Night and Vienna
======
<!--Schottenfeldgasse 95 was the starting point for me in Vienna. On the street, you will see Nazim Hikmet Kultur Cafe that is named from Turkish poet, Nazim Hikmet Ran. After met someone, get informed and drink your Turkish tea, I decide to visit -->

The night means opera for a wealthy Viennese. One of the most play is 
"<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Entführung_aus_dem_Serail' target='_blank'>Die Entführung aus dem Serail</a>" opera Singspiel in three acts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The Opera House has very fascinating architecture. You can visit the building without getting ticket for an opera event, of course in the day-time. For most tourists and Viennese, the night begin in Schewedenplatz. You can choose to go city-centre to walk old streets, and if you want to give some break, may settle into a café to taste *Wiener Melange* which is more milky Cappucino.

The 90s childs would remember the American romantic drama, *Before Sunrise*, acted by Ethan Hawke (Jesse) and Julie Delphi (Céline). The movie told these two guys romantic approach from sunset that they share a kiss at the top of the Wiener Riesenrad, to sunrise while they are touring Vienna.
