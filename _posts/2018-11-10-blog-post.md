People (who are the 2nd war children) lived a though, but emotional period at the 60s and 70s. Afterthat 80s began as technology driving ebullient period unlike 60s, 70s. The art moved to a new dimension with 80s. *Freedom to everyone for everything* was the motto inherited by 70s, the flower children (the term originated from  H. G. Wells's The Time Machine) now put their targets to future. Loves to the nature turns to *cry for the moon*. Well, did they succeed? Yes, they did. American dream has rised up again.
