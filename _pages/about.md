I am currently a PostDoc research assistant in the Department of Physics of the Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University. I recently completed my Ph.D. (on Dec. 2016) at the Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University with a thesis entitled "Photometric analysis of transit light curves of exoplanets". And still continue to study on exoplanets.
